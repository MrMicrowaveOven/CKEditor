# CKEditor Playground

Just a simple webpage with a CKEditor on it.

# How do I play with it?

On your command prompt, navigate into where you would like the repository stored.  Then type:

`git clone https://github.com/MrMicrowaveOven/CKEditor.git`

It will copy the repository onto your machine.

`cd CKEditor` will get you into the repo, then `open index.html` will open the page with your default browser.  The path can also be copied into other browsers, if desired.

To edit the CKEditor, open the `ckeditor/config.js` file.  Copy and paste a toolbar configuration into this document, save the document, then refresh the page in your browser.

Enjoy!
