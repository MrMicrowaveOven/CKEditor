# CKEditor Playground

Just a simple webpage with a CKEditor on it.

# How do I play with it?

On your command prompt, navigate into where you would like the repository stored.  Then type:

`git clone https://github.com/MrMicrowaveOven/CKEditor.git`

It will copy the repository onto your machine.

`cd CKEditor` will get you into the repo, then `open index.html` will open the page with your default browser.  The path can also be copied into other browsers, if desired.

To edit the CKEditor, open the `ckeditor/config.js` file.  Copy and paste a toolbar configuration into this document, save the document, then refresh the page in your browser.

# The Meeting Template Plugin

With this plugin, you can simply click the icon (look for lips) and the Meeting Template will be autogenerated into your editor.

# How do I add this amazing Meeting Template Plugin?

## Easy way:

Set your config file how you want it (ignore this if you're confused).

Type `git pull origin master` into your console.  It will update everything to the new version, while keeping your current changes.

## Hard way (if the easy way doesn't work):

Add the `meetingtemplate` folder to the `plugins` folder.  Then add `config.extraPlugins = "meetingtemplate";` to the `config.js` file on the second-to-last line, directly below the `config.removeButtons` line.

Save everything and refresh your page.

Enjoy!
